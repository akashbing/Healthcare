POC  – Health Care Data Processing POC
------------------------

Input Format - .pdf

Input Data Format
PATIENTID	PATINENT_NAME	AGE	GENDER	DISEASE_INFO	HOSPITALNAME ADMITED_DATE ADDRESSOFPATIENT
Example:

100001	SarathSexsena	39 Male Cancer Care Hospital 2015-15-04	2ndCross,BTRoad ,Mumbai

like the above please create 3000 records(at least) on your own with TAB Delimiter


REQUIREMENT:
------------

  1. take the complete PDF Input data on HDFS
  
  2. Develope a Map Reduce Use Case to get the below filtered results
     from the HDFS Input data(PDF data)

     If age > 35 && Gender is ‘Male’

          - If DISEASE_INFO is Cancer OR TB  --> store the results in  "EmergencyCare"
          -If ‘ADMITED_DATE’ IN BETWEEN 2015-04-01 to2015-07-31  --> store "SeasonalCareSection"
          
          
     If age >50  && Gender ‘Male’ or ‘Female’
    
          - If address is ‘Jarkhand’; --> store "Dengue-Care Section"
          - IF ‘ADMITED_DATE’ IN BETWEEN 2015-09-01 to2015-12-31 --> ‘WinderSeasonal-Care Section’
    else
         
          store in "General Care Section"
LOAD '/Hlthnew4/EmergencyCare-r-00000' using PigStorage('\t') as (pid:int,p$

  NOTE: In the mentioned file names only 5 outputs have to be generated


  3. Develop a PIG Script to filter the Map Reduce Output in the below fashion

       - Provide the Unique data

       - Sort the Unique data based on PatientID.

  4. EXPORT the same PIG Output from HDFS to MySQL using SQOOP

  5. Develop a Dashboard solution using either Structs or Springs framework

     to see the results in a Reporting Manner
  
  6. Store the same PIG Output in a HIVE External Table

NOTE: 1. Prepare a very clear Presention with Flow Chart
         Architectural Diagram explaining the complete flow
    
      2. Prepare a Technical Deployment document which depicts 
         Execution flow.

      3. Complete code should be in a single shell script file
        Ex:  healthCarePoc.sh
